                        My name is Julian, I am a senior at Florida State University
                        pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.
                        Starting in Fall of 2025, I will be pursuing a Masters of Engineering
                        in Computer Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, where I plan
                        to further my education in developing embedded systems, computer 
                        architecture, and machine learning.

                        Through the Directed Reading Program at the Math Department at FSU
                        I am studying the ensemble kalman filter, an advanced data assimilation
                        algorithm. The ensemble kalman filter is an iterative algorithm that 
                        aims to predict the state of some system given observations. As the system
                        advances in time, the model gives less weight to new observations overcoming
                        noise.
